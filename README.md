# string-length-solidity-lib
This is a solidity Library for getting the length of a string.


## Useage

1. Contract Method
  This Lib contract can be imported into a project and the contract method; "stringlen" passing a string which you want to get it value...
  

2. Using the "use" keyword to expand the functionality of the string datatype and then call the "stringlen" as though it is a native string method.
